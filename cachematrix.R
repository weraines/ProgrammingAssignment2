## This is a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the
## matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve will retrieve the inverse from
## the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
